        <h2>Sleep Apnea Detection Project</h2>
        <p>This project aims to detect sleep apnea using machine learning techniques and physiological data. Sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. The goal of the project is to use a dataset of sleep-related information (such as heart rate, oxygen levels, and breathing patterns) to predict whether a person has sleep apnea.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Data preprocessing using Python and Pandas to clean and handle missing data.</li>
            <li>Feature extraction using statistical and time-series analysis techniques.</li>
            <li>Model building using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Regression.</li>
            <li>Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.</li>
            `
        </ul>
